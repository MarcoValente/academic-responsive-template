What are we made of? How was the universe created and which features of nature
allowed stars, planets and life to exist today? These are only some of the
fundamental questions that have fascinated humans for centuries, and **only 
partial answers to these questions have been found today**. Particle Physics provides a
remarkable description of the atomic and subatomic world that, going back in time
to the Big Bang, allows to explain many of the features of the currently observed
universe. However, not all these features are currently understood. 
Some open questions of physics are:

* What is the Dark Matter, an unknown type of matter composing ~23% of the
  mass of our universe?
* Why are we made of matter and not of anti-matter?
* How can we unify gravity with the other elementary forces (electroweak, strong)?

One way to test our explanations to these questions is through **collider experiments**, allowing 
to probe the existence of new phenomena at high energy.

My research focuses on the colliders domain, in particular on the measurements carried
out by the [ATLAS experiment](https://atlas.cern), a multi-purpose physics detector
composed today by a collaboration of more than 3000 scientists and 181
institutions distributed around the world.

This machine, records the outcome of the collisions provided every 25 ns by the [Large 
Hadron Collider (LHC)](https://home.cern/science/accelerators/large-hadron-collider), a 27 km long proton-proton (pp) collider located at the 
[European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN)](https://home.cern) facility, near 
Geneva (Switzerland).
The detector is composed of:
1. An *Inner Detector* (ID) allowing to reconstruct tracks left by charged
   particles passing through the detectors.
2. A *Calorimeter system*, composed of an Electromagnetic (EM) and a Hadronic
   (HAD) calorimeter, stopping both neutral and charged particles and allowing
   to measure their energies.
3. A *Muon Spectrometer* (MS) allowing to reconstruct tracks left by muons passing
   through the calorimeter system without being stopped.
4. A *Trigger and Data Acquisition System* (TDAQ) allowing to reduce the huge amount 
   of data produced by the LHC and retain interesting collisions.


## Jets and Missing Transverse Momentum

New high energy phenomena could manifest themselves in many different ways inside the pp collisions of the LHC. One common feature of new physics events is the **anomalous abundance of collisions having strongly interacting particles** (*i.e.* quarks and gluons)in their final states. 
Strongly interacting particles 
manifest themselves in high energy collisions as *hadronic jets*. **A jet is a spray of well collimated particles** generated from the showering of the initial quark or gluon. The reconstruction, identification and calibration of such objects inside the ATLAS volume represents a crucial task for the physics searches carried out by the experiment.

Another extremely important set of particles indicating the production of new phenomena at the LHC are the **invisible particles** (i.e. the neutrinos and Dark Matter particles) which can escape the ATLAS volume undetected. Despite these particles will not release any type of visible energy inside the experiment, their identification is well possible through the exploit of the transverse momentum conservation law. This leads to the **Missing Transverse Momentum (MET), defined as the total imbalance of the transverse momentum in the visible particles** produced in a pp collision of the LHC expressed as
