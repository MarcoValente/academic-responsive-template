**What are we made of?** How was the universe created and which features of nature
allowed stars, planets and life to exist today? These are only some of the
fundamental questions that have fascinated humans for centuries, and **only 
partial answers to these questions have been found today**. Particle Physics provides a
remarkable description of the atomic and subatomic world also known as the *Standard Model of Particle Physics*. Going back in time
to primordial phases of the universe right after the Big Bang, the Standard Model allows to explain many of the current features of the
universe. However, **not all these features are currently well understood** and many different questions of physics
are still open today such as:

* Why is the universe made of matter and not of anti-matter?
* What is the Dark Matter, an unknown type of matter composing ~23% of the
  mass of our universe?
* How can we unify gravity with the other elementary forces (electroweak and strong forces) at high energy?

One way to test our explanations to these questions is through **collider experiments**, allowing 
to probe the existence of new physics phenomena through collisions of elementary particles at high energy. 

## *A* *T*oroidal *L*HC *A*pparatu*S* (*ATLAS*)

My research focuses on the searches for new phenomena carried
out by the [ATLAS experiment](https://atlas.cern), a multi-purpose physics detector
built by a collaboration composed of 3000 scientists and 181 institutions distributed across the world.

This machine, records the outcome of the collisions provided every 25 ns by the [Large 
Hadron Collider (LHC)](https://home.cern/science/accelerators/large-hadron-collider), a 27 km long proton-proton (pp) collider located at the 
[European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN)](https://home.cern) facility, near 
Geneva (Switzerland).
The detector is composed of:
1. An *Inner Detector* (ID) allowing to reconstruct tracks left by charged
   particles.
2. A *Calorimeter system*, composed of an Electromagnetic (EM) and a Hadronic
   (HAD) calorimeter, allowing to measure energies of both neutral and charged particles by stopping them inside its volume.
3. A *Muon Spectrometer* (MS) allowing to reconstruct tracks left by muon particles passing
   through the calorimeter system without being trapped.
4. A *Trigger and Data Acquisition System* (TDAQ) allowing to reduce the huge amount 
   of data flow of the LHC while retaining interesting collisions.

## Searches Higgs-boson pair production and Supersymmetry (SUSY)

The discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012 finally confirmed that Standard Model particles acquire mass through a process known as *Spontaneous-Electroweak-Symmetry Breaking* (or also *Brout–Englert–Higgs mechanism*). This discovery also tells us that, in the history of the universe, **a phase-transition occurred approximately 10^-11^ s after the Big-Bang**, marking the passage from a universe composed of massless particles (*i.e.* the EW symmetry is unbroken) to a universe where particles are massive. This epoch is known as the **Electroweak Phase Transition (EWPT) of the universe** and only **very little information about this phase-transition is known today**.

In particular, the EWPT epoch could contain the key to **explain the baryon-antibaryon asymmetry of the universe** through a theoretical process known as **Electroweak Baryogenesis (EWB)**. However, similarly to other cosmological problems such as the [flatness of the universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatness_problem) or the [horizon problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizon_problem), EWB requires the presence of a **very fast expansion of the early universe** known as [cosmological inflation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_(cosmology)) that the Standard Model currently fails to predict.

## Jets and Missing Transverse Momentum

New high energy phenomena could manifest themselves in many different ways inside the pp collisions of the LHC. However, one possible feature of new physics phenomena could be the **anomalous production of resonances decaying to strongly interacting particles**, commonly referred to as quarks and gluons. Strongly interacting particles generally appear inside ATLAS as hadronic jets. **A jet is a spray of well collimated particles** generated from the [hadronization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadronization) of a quark or a gluon. The reconstruction, identification and calibration of such objects represents a vital task where I have been deeply involved in the last years, both on the online (i.e. the trigger) and offline side.

Another important set of particles indicating the production of new phenomena at the LHC are the **invisible particles such as neutrinos and Dark Matter**. These particles are extremely difficult to be directly detected as these could pass through the detector without leaving any significant electric signal. Even though the direct detection of these particles is complicated, the indirect identification of their production is well possible exploiting the expected conservation of transverse momentum in pp collisions. Indeed, the expected balance between the transverse momentum carried out by the visible and invisible particles allows to define the total transverse momentum carried out by the invisible particles in a collision as

This quantity is generally referred to as the **Missing Transverse Momentum (MET)**. Due to the large dependency of this quantity from the correct functioning of the full set of ATLAS sub-detectors and the multiple pp interactions of the LHC (also known as pileup), this quantity has to be constantly monitored and validated during the data-taking periods of the LHC. In the past, I have been largely involved in the activities associated to this quantity.
