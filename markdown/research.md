What are we made of? How was the universe created and which features of nature
allowed stars, planets and life to exist today? These are only some of the
fundamental questions that have fascinated humans for centuries, and **only 
partial answers to these questions have been found today**. Particle Physics provides a
remarkable description of the atomic and subatomic world also known as the *Standard Model of Particle Physics*. Going back in time
to primordial phases of the universe after the Big Bang, the Standard Model allows to explain many of the current features of the
universe. However, many other features are the observed universe are currently not well understand, and many fundamental questions of physics
are still open such as:

* Why are we made of matter and not of anti-matter?
* What is the Dark Matter, an unknown type of matter composing ~23% of the
  mass of our universe?
* How can we unify gravity with the other elementary forces (electroweak and strong forces) at high energy?

One way to test our explanations to these questions is through **collider experiments**, allowing 
to probe the existence of new phenomena at high energy. 

## *A* *T*oroidal *L*HC *A*pparatu*S* (*ATLAS*)

My research focuses on the colliders domain, in particular on the searches for new phenomena carried
out by the [ATLAS experiment](https://atlas.cern), a multi-purpose physics detector
composed today by a collaboration of more than 3000 scientists and 181
institutions distributed around the world.

This machine, records the outcome of the collisions provided every 25 ns by the [Large 
Hadron Collider (LHC)](https://home.cern/science/accelerators/large-hadron-collider), a 27 km long proton-proton (pp) collider located at the 
[European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN)](https://home.cern) facility, near 
Geneva (Switzerland).
The detector is composed of:
1. An *Inner Detector* (ID) allowing to reconstruct tracks left by charged
   particles passing through the detectors.
2. A *Calorimeter system*, composed of an Electromagnetic (EM) and a Hadronic
   (HAD) calorimeter, stopping both neutral and charged particles and allowing
   to measure their energies.
3. A *Muon Spectrometer* (MS) allowing to reconstruct tracks left by muons passing
   through the calorimeter system without being trapped.
4. A *Trigger and Data Acquisition System* (TDAQ) allowing to reduce the huge amount 
   of data flow of the LHC, while retaining interesting collisions.


## Jets and Missing Transverse Momentum

New high energy phenomena could manifest themselves in many different ways inside the pp collisions of the LHC. However, one possible feature of new physics phenomena could be the **anomalous production of resonances decaying to strongly interacting particles**, commonly referred to as quarks and gluons. Strongly interacting particles generally appear inside ATLAS as hadronic jets. **A jet is a spray of well collimated particles** generated from the [hadronization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadronization) of a quark or a gluon. The reconstruction, identification and calibration of such objects represents a vital task where I have been deeply involved in the last years, both on the online (i.e. the trigger) and offline side.

Another important set of particles indicating the production of new phenomena at the LHC are the **invisible particles such as neutrinos and Dark Matter particles**. These particles are extremely difficult to be directly detected inside ATLAS as these could pass through the detector without leaving any significant electric signal. Even though the direct detection of these particles is complicated, the indirect identification of their production through the expected conservation of transverse momentum conservation is well possible. Indeed, the perfectly expected balance between the transverse momentum carried out by the visible and invisible particles allows to define the total transverse momentum carried out by the invisible particles as

This quantity is generally referred to as the **Missing Transverse Momentum (MET)**. Due to the large dependency of this quantity from the correct functioning of the full set of ATLAS sub-detectors and the multiple pp interactions of the LHC (also known as pileup), this quantity has to be constantly monitored and validated during the data-taking periods of the LHC. In the past, I have been largely involved in the activities associated to this quantity.
